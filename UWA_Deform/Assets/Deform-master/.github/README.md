A fully-featured deformer system for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). Deform is multi-threaded with the [Job System](https://unity.com/dots), compiled with [Burst](https://unity.com/dots) and calculations are done using the [Mathematics library](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity.Mathematics/blob/master/readme.md).

## Features
✔️ Lightning fast!

✔️ Fully multi-threaded!

✔️ 40+ deformers!

✔️ Meshes can be saved!

✔️ Easily extendable!

✔️ Works in worldspace!

✔️ Custom editors and handles!

## FAQ
> Does Deform work with the new prefab system?

Yes. Deform works seamlessly with nested prefabs and prefab variants.

> Do deformers have to be on the object they are deforming?

No. Because deformables require deformers be added manually, they can be anywhere in the scene and on any game object.

> Can deformables share deformers?

Yes. You can create a single deformer and add it to multiple deformables.

> How do deformables handle instancing?

Each deformable has it's own unique mesh. Duplicating and instantiating deformables shouldn't cause any issues.

## Limitations
Deform runs on the CPU. While it *is* incredibly fast, you should not expect to get performance comparable to vertex shaders. Because meshes are modified on the CPU each mesh has to be unique. From what I understand, this means each mesh will require a new draw call. Deform is not meant to be used at a massive scale. If you need to deform an entire world, tons of meshes, or an incredibly high poly model use vertex shaders. 

**tldr:** Use shaders if you need speed, use Deform if you need modularity and ease-of-use.

## Authors Note
Thanks so much for checking out Deform! It's been my passion project since 2016 and has undergone **4 rewrites**! For a long time I planned to charge money for this tool, but I've decided to release it for free for a few reasons:

1. I'm self-taught and still quite young. I take pride in this, but it's made it hard to "get a foot in the door". I don't have a college to help me get an internship or a degree to vouch for my skill so I need to show my programming prowess by making badass projects. I *could* sell Deform but I see that as a short-term solution. My long-term goal is to make awesome tools for an awesome company. Making my projects free and open-source is the best way to get my code in the hands of a possible employer.
2. I wouldn't have been able to make this tool if the game-dev community wasn't so supportive. I want to give back to the community in some way.
3. Now that it's open-source other people can contribute to the project! I think Deform is awesome right now, but there's always room for improvement and I'm excited to see what cool stuff people want to add!
